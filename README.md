<div align="left">

## Description

My very own modificaion of GDMegaOverlay. Currently supports Geometry Dash 2.204

![Menu screen](/img/screen.png)

## New Version is on the way!!

## ATENTION!!

This is **NOT** meant to rival GD Mega Overlay. it is just a **FUN** project for me to work on, Do **NOT** beg for updates or for this to sync with GDMO's updates, if you want GDMO support use maxnu's project, I will **NOT** fix GDMO's issues leave them to the GDMO devs to fix or say them to fix.

## Installation

> **Warning** <br>
> Only download the source code for development purposes.[^1] See below to install the modification/overlay to your installation of Geometry Dash.

> **Note:** <br>
> This Project only supports **Windows** and **Linux** (Through WINE) (I use Arch btw).
